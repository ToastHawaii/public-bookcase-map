# Public bookcase

[Click here for the map](https://book-exchange.zottelig.ch)

This simple map shows public bookcases near you. The information is loaded from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

## What are public bookcases?

A public or open bookcase is a cabinet, shelf or box used for the exchange and storage of books. The public bookcase is available to the general public. The exchange is free of charge, anonymous and without any formalities.

## Why this map?

I have not found a map showing the open bookcases, street libraries, bookboxes, reading boxes, open bookshelves and reading banks from OSM. Because I find the public bookcases a good thing and want to support it, I have created this map.

## How can I register a public bookcase?

Thank you very much for your commitment! [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is a project that anyone can participate in. Everything goes through the website, the tools are designed so simple that anyone can use them.

Checkout the [Open Bookcase Map from MapComplete](https://pietervdvn.github.io/MapComplete/index.html?quests=bookcases), for a step-by-step introduction to OpenStreetMap.

How to document a public bookcase is described on this [wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Tag:amenity%3Dpublic_bookcase).

### Can I do this without registering?

Yes. Use the <i class="fas fa-comment-alt"></i> note button in the map corner.

## Is there anything else to do?

Sure, helping hands are always welcome and there is something for everyone to do.

### Do you like to be outside?

Then find public bookcases and add them in [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org). Always check if they really exist by visiting them.

- Look at [the beautiful map from Binnette](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/osm-bookcases-and-boite-a-lire_362287#15/45.2010/5.7389), which is based on the data of [boite-a-lire](https://www.boite-a-lire.com/). [Click here for the project website from Binnette's bookcases-to-check](https://github.com/Binnette/bookcases-to-check).
- Do research on the Internet.
- Look out for bookcases when you're on the go.

[Vespucci (Android)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vespucci) and [Go Map!! (iOS)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Go_Map!!) are useful helpers on the road.

### Do you like to take pictures?

Visit already registered public bookcases and photograph them and link the picture in OpenStreetMap. The map supports the tags mapillary, flickr, wikimedia_commons and image. [Wiki page about Photo linking](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Photo_linking)
