# Public bookcase

[Click here for the map](https://public-bookcase.github.io/map.html)

This simple map shows public bookcases near you. The information is loaded from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

## Why this map?

I have not found a map showing the open bookcases, street libraries, bookboxes, reading boxes, open bookshelves and reading banks from OSM. In order to appreciate this and because I find the public bookcases a good thing and want to support it, I have created this map.

## Is this map also available as an app?

You can add this map to your homescreen from your smartphone. Use the "add to homescreen" function in your browser (iOS, Android, etc.)

## How can I register a public bookcase?

Thank you very much for your commitment! [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is a project that anyone can participate in. Everything goes through the website, the tools are designed so simple that anyone can use them.

How to document a public bookcase is described on this [wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Tag:amenity%3Dpublic_bookcase).

## Can I do this without registering?

Yes. Use the note button in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

## I have a website, can I use this map?

Yes, the code is free for use, copying and modification.
