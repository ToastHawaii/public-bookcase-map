# Public bookcase

[Click here for the map](https://public-bookcase.github.io/map.html)

This simple map shows public bookcases near you. The information is loaded from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

## What are public bookcases?

A public or open bookcase is a cabinet, shelf or box used for the exchange and storage of books. The public bookcase is available to the general public. The exchange is free of charge, anonymous and without any formalities.

## Why this map?

I have not found a map showing the open bookcases, street libraries, bookboxes, reading boxes, open bookshelves and reading banks from OSM. Because I find the public bookcases a good thing and want to support it, I have created this map.
