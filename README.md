# Public bookcase

[Click here for the map](https://public-bookcase.github.io/map.html)

This simple map shows public bookcases near you. The information is loaded from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

## What are public bookcases?

A public or open bookcase is a cabinet, shelf or box used for the exchange and storage of books. The public bookcase is available to the general public. The exchange is free of charge, anonymous and without any formalities.

## Why this map?

I have not found a map showing the open bookcases, street libraries, bookboxes, reading boxes, open bookshelves and reading banks from OSM. Because I find the public bookcases a good thing and want to support it, I have created this map.

## How can I register a public bookcase?

Thank you very much for your commitment! [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is a project that anyone can participate in. Everything goes through the website, the tools are designed so simple that anyone can use them.

How to document a public bookcase is described on this [wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Tag:amenity%3Dpublic_bookcase).

### Can I do this without registering?

Yes. Use the note button in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

## Is there anything else to do?

Sure, helping hands are always welcome:
- Find bookcases and add them in [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org). But always check if they really exist in real life, on the field.
    - Research on the Internet.
    - Look out for bookcases when you're on the go. 
    - Look at [the beautiful map from Binnette](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/osm-bookcases-and-boite-a-lire_362287#15/45.2010/5.7389), which is based on the data of [boite-a-lire](https://www.boite-a-lire.com/).
